LaTeX is a typesetting programming language used to produce beautiful documents. It especially excels at scientific, mathematic, and engineering specific layouts, but can be used to produce nearly any sort of document. This workshop will teach you the basics of LaTeX, including how to render things like chemical formulas with ease.
