# Machine Learning with R: Random Forest Classification Approach

Join us for a workshop on Random Forest. Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the concept of decision trees, where multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are combined to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction.
