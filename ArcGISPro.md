# Making and Sharing Maps with ArcGIS Pro

ArcGIS Pro is a professional desktop Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. It is a powerful data visualization tool that maps and analyzes data, depicting patterns and trends.

This workshop is geared towards beginners new to ArcGIS or ArcMap users making the switch to ArcGIS Pro. Attendees will become familiar with ArcGIS tools that are available on campus, learn the ArcGIS Pro interface, symbolize data, and share the resulting map.
