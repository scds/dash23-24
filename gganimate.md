# Creating Animated Plots in R using gganimate

This virtual workshop will build on the [Fall 2023 workshop “Data Visualization in R using ggplot2”](ggplot2) to provide an introduction to gganimate in the statistical programming language R. This workshop will go examples on how to create visualizations that change over time and how to and customize the design of those graphs.
